The website has the following path/pages:

- home
- contact
- products
- product detail
- cart

- login

This website has pages for customers and pages for admins.

The website displayes the user can buy.
Different products (shoes) gets displayed (title, price, image), and when clicking on it, you will get more information about it (title, description, image, price, add to card button). 

The website has a search function (filtering), so only products that the searched text matches will get listed.

If you buy the product, it will go to the cart page, and the product title, price, image gets displayed. If user clicks on the product inside the cart page, they will come back to the product view page.

An admin with the correct username, password and email can login to the site, and edit existing products, and also add new products to the site.-
Admin can choose the product title, description, price, image and if the product is featured or not when creating a new product.
